# Lab: Machine Learning Intro

## Overview
A key developer skill is the ability to use internet resources effectively. Especially when learning a new topic.
For this lab converting an excellent tutorial from a couple years ago. Does it still work? Let’s find out!

## Feature Tasks and Requirements
* a task is to convert Practical Text Classification With Python and Keras tutorial into a running Jupyter Notebook.
* To accomplish a primary task, install is done several libraries and external assets.
* A big part of this lab is building resilience when faced with an incomplete solution.
   Because most of the time that’s what internet is going to give you.
   
## Implementation Notes
*  Several dependenciese are installed. (pandas , sklearn).
* In the project external assets is used to particular locations, and with particular names [The link of assets thet have been used](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences).
